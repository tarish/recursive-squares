Source, Test, and Demo code based on a code challenge I completed 2/2019.
Requirements of the challenge removed per challenge provider's request.
I have also renamed the repo and stripped all previous commits from this source,
which contain details of the original challenge.

Any changes I make from here on out (ex. I'd like to try a different design approach for myself)
will be included in this repo.
