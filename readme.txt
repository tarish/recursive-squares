Source, Test, and Demo code based on a code challenge I completed 2/2019.
Original author granted me permission to push my solution to GitHub
and also requested the readme not contain the requirements of the challenge.
Thus, I have renamed the repo and stripped all previous commits from this source,
which contain details of the original challenge.

Any changes I make from here on out (ex. I'd like to try a different design approach for myself)
will be included in this repo.
